            <p class="murals-p">Back when I was a kid I would always 
                look at graffiti characters on Google and be like damn.. 
                I want to one day be able to draw cool characters like 
                that! I would put my paper on the screen and trace out 
                the character then color it in. I would try to draw my 
                own. I was never able to get anywhere close to what 
                other people could draw. Now that im old and have found 
                my own style I see how people made those characters. 
                Now that I have learned how to make weird funky characters 
                I can tell you guys it's all about finding your own style and 
                drawing eyes and noses and ears. Then trying to put it all 
                together with a lot of color and just see what happens. If it works 
                and if it doesn't change it so that it will work.

                <p class="murals-p">Little backstory on this guy, I went over to my buddy's house to watch
                 the fights and I saw he had a bunch of spray paint in the barn/shed,
                 and I asked if he would let me paint a little somethin somethin. He said run it!
                 Next thing you know buddy's out here for like 30 min getting Bob Ross and this
                 is the outcome! It's still there to this day!
